## Timer ‚è±

This is a simple timer implemented in JavaScript.

## Credit

This project was built following a tutorial by Stephen Grider from [The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp Course (2022)](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/). I've expanded on the project by fixing bugs and adding styling.

## Improvements

- When pausing the timer the border will continue from where it was paused.
- When changing the input field during countdown, the border will restart from the top.
- Added styling and colors.
