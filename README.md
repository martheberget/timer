## Timer ‚è±

This is a simple timer implemented in JavaScript.

## Credit

This project was built following a tutorial by Stephen Grider from [The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp Course (2022)](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/). I've expanded on the prject by adding new features, fixing bugs and adding styling.

## Improvements

- Fixed a bug where the border would restart every time the timer was paused. Border will now continue the animation from where it was paused.
- Added styling, colors, and gradient background image.
