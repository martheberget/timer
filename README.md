## Credit

Inspired by Stephen Grider from [The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp Course (2022)](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial/). This project was created solely for the purpose of practicing coding skills and learning new technologies.

## Improvements

I've expanded on the project by adding timer reset functionality, styling, unit tests using Mocha, and routing with Express.js.
